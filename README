  This is a quickie (functional, but incomplete) port of the RubyGem cheats. 
  It allows you to easily get a a cheat sheet for a technology.
  I ported it to make it easier for windows users who don't have ruby.
  See http://cheat.errtheblog.com for more details about the original vision.
  I also added support for asp.net sheets using a diff server repository.
  If you have a cheat sheet that you'd like added just email me:
  bryanthankins [at] gmail.com
  
  USAGE: 1) Compile the exe and place in c:\windows
         2) Run through cmd prompt, vim or VS.NET (using external tools)
               cheat -r sheets: list ruby cheat sheets
               cheat -r <sheet name>: ruby cheat sheet system
               cheat sheets: to see all asp.net cheat sheets
               cheat <sheet name>: asp.net cheat systems
               
  ISSUES: 
  If it's not working, make sure you have the app.config (or cheat.exe.config) 
  deployed with the app. This allows it to get through a proxy
