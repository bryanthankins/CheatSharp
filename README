 This is a quickie (functional, but incomplete) port of the RubyGem cheats. 
 It allows you to easily get a a cheat sheet for a technology.
 I ported it to make it easier for windows users who don't have ruby.
 See http://cheat.errtheblog.com for more details about the original vision.
 
 USAGE:
 1) Get the code from git@github.com:bryanthankins/CheatSharp.git
 2) Compile
 3) Run cheat.exe from the command line and pass it the name of a cheatsheet like "cheat vimdiff" or "cheat sheets" to see all the sheets
